This library is intended to drive a rotary encoder.

For now, it's based on polling the pins as often as possible. Further developpment may lead to interrupt based polling.

Simply import it in your Arduino Sketch, call begin() in the setup by passing the two pins the encoder is plugged on, and call update on each loop.

getStep() returns 1 or -1 each time the encoder is incremented. Sign gives the direction.
reverse() change the sign of the value getStep() returns. 
setDebounceDelay() change the delay used for debounce. if not called, it will default at 1 millisecond.

Your free to use this library for wathever project your working on.
